<p><h3>The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me is the third studio album by American rock band Brand New. 
    It was released on November 21, 2006, through Interscope Records, making it their major label debut. 
    Recorded from 2005-2006 in studios on Long Island and Massachusetts with producer Mike Sapone, 
    the album arose following the online leaking of several unfinished demos that were meant to be early blueprints of an upcoming record. 
    Two singles from the album were released – "Sowing Season" on November 21, 2006, and "Jesus Christ" on April 30, 2007. 
    The album peaked at #31 on the Billboard 200, becoming the band's highest-charting record at the time of its release.</h3></p>
