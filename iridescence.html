<p><h3>Iridescence (stylized in all lowercase) is the fourth studio and first major label album by American band Brockhampton, 
    released on September 21, 2018 by their own Question Everything, Inc. and RCA Records, 
    as their major label debut and the first installment of their The Best Years of Our Lives trilogy. 
    The self-produced album was recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London, as well as the group's own studio in Hawaii. 
    It is their first album since rapper Ameer Vann's departure from the group following sexual misconduct allegations.
    It debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 albums chart, becoming the group's first chart-topping album.</h3></p>
